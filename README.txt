Bombadinho is a Mathlab/GNU Octave Syntax Analyser (for now...)

Syntax Analyser files included:
ast.c
ast.h
interpreter.c
Makefile
parser.bison
scanner.flex

There are a few mathlab-examples included aswell so you can test that Bombadinho actually does what he says he does !

The Makefile has several routines to help you out using this powerfull tool!
How to use it:
  make all - compiles everying it needs to compile to run !
  make clean - cleans any residual files created by a previous compilation
  make test - tests Bombadinho with the mathlab-examples provided
